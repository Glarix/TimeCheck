# TimeCheck


A small beginner project.


V1.0(no real testing, a lot of bugs might be easily found)


This program reads the content of scores.txt file to get the current record.

The purpose is to test the users reaction time.

User is asked to type the number of tests he wants to run and the nickname
that he wants to be stored in scores.txt if record is bitten.

For each test, the user has to wait a random amount of time (between 1 and
5 seconds) and press Enter as fast as he can after that period.

The time taken for the user to press Enter is compared with current record
and if faster, the record is replaced. After every round, the current record
is displayed on the screen.


V1.01(no real testing, a lot of bugs might be easily found)

Now you can see your score after each test.
Nothing else added.

NOTES:
* The scores.txt file MUST be in the same directory as the source file

IDEAS TO IMPLEMENT
*Maybe a way to show all the results at the end of every test- **Done**
