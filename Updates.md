V1.02

Added two new features.

1. Now if user pressed Enter before the timer was over the test is considered invalid and the result is not displayed nor counted as the new record. If a test is invalid, no score shows up after that test is over.

2. Added a table of scores which  stores the result of every valid test, or -1 for each invalid test. After all tests are done, the table is displayed on the screen, along with user's name.
